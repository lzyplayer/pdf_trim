Range scan registration has attracted broad interests due to its wide
applications in robot mapping [1–3], 3D model reconstruction [4, 5],
object recognition [6, 7] and etc. The task of registration is to calculate
the optimal transformation for two or more range scans so as
to transfer them into one coordinate system and recover the original
scene of a 3D object. Based on the number of scans to be registered,
this problem can be classified into two categories: pair-wise registration
and multi-view registration. The most popular method for
pair-wise registration is the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm
proposed by Besl et al. [8], which iteratively builds up correspondences
and calculates the optimal transformation by minimizing the
residual error. Although the ICP algorithm has good performance in
efficiency, it is a local convergent approach. Besides, this approach
can not be applied to scan pairs that contain large non-overlapping
areas. Therefore, a lot of ICP variants were proposed for pair-wise
registration.
